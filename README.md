Color picker


Project number 25- Color picker
Idea of this project is for students to go through generating different colors in assembler. Firstly, on the beginning screen, 3 rectangles are shown with basic colors with arbitrary size (red, blue and yellow). Below the rectangles, respectively there are letters R, B and Y to denote which colors are shown above in the rectangles. It is expected from the user to input at most 2 letters. And then you have to choose a shade, going from 1 to 9, where 1 denotes black and 9 denotes white. 9 rectangles are shown in a chosen color ranging from black to white and below them they are noted with 9 figures. If 2 letters are selected, 9 rectangles are shown in 3 different colors (orange, purple and green). After choosing the shade, before selected text “Color picker” is displayed in the chosen color.
